# AGENTS

This repository uses Node.js and TypeScript with React.

- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` before committing.
- Use `npm run fmt` to format code.
- Prefer small, descriptive commits written in the imperative mood.
- Follow conventions documented in subdirectory `AGENTS.md` files when modifying code within them.
- Avoid Git LFS pointer issues:
  - Install Git LFS locally with `git lfs install`.
  - After cloning, run `git lfs pull` to download binary files.
  - If pointer text appears in working files, run `git lfs checkout` to replace them.
