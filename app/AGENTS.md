# AGENTS

This directory hosts the React front end written in TypeScript.

- Use `.ts`/`.tsx` files with strict typing.
- Prefer functional components, hooks, and named exports.
- Apply styling with Tailwind utility classes.
- Organize code under existing folders (components, hooks, routes, etc.).
- After changes, run the repository root checks: `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`.
