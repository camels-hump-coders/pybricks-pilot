# PyBricks Pilot

A modern web-based interface for programming and controlling LEGO Spike Prime robots with Pybricks. Features real-time telemetry, remote control capabilities, and a virtual competition mat for FLL teams.

## Features

### üöÄ Core Functionality
- **Bluetooth Connection**: Connect to LEGO Spike Prime hubs via Web Bluetooth
- **Live Programming**: Upload and run Python programs directly on the hub
- **Real-time Telemetry**: Monitor motors, sensors, IMU data, and drivebase position
- **Remote Control**: Manual robot control with continuous drive modes

### üéÆ Competition Support
- **Virtual FLL Mat**: Interactive competition mat with proper 93" √ó 45" dimensions
- **Robot Visualization**: Real-time robot position tracking and movement animation  
- **Click-to-Position**: Easy robot placement and heading adjustment
- **Telemetry Reset**: Reset position and telemetry data for new runs

### üîß Development Tools
- **Auto-Instrumentation**: Automatic telemetry injection with PybricksPilot module
- **Program Output Log**: View robot program output and debug information
- **File System Integration**: Browse and edit Python files directly
- **Parallel Execution**: Background telemetry while running user programs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with Web Bluetooth support (Chrome, Edge, Opera)
- LEGO Spike Prime hub with Pybricks firmware

### Installation
